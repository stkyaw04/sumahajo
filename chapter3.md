# The Exciting Day

The day finally arrived. The stage was set in the park, decorated with colorful lights and ribbons. Excitement buzzed in the air as the audience gathered. Lucy danced gracefully, Tom played an impressive set on his drums, and Mia sang beautifully, wowing everyone. 

Finally, it was Jack’s turn. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the stage. The spotlight was bright, and the crowd cheered wildly. 

“Welcome to my spectacular act! ” he called out, waving his arms. “Today, you'll see something you’ve never seen before — Jack the Multi-Talented! ”

He grabbed a guitar and strummed a few chords but quickly forgot the lyrics. “Uh, let’s move on to juggling! ” he said, putting the guitar down. 

Jack hurried to grab the three colorful balls he prepared earlier. He tossed them up confidently, but they wobbled and fell all over the place. The crowd giggled, and Jack blushed. “I meant to do that! ” he said, trying to save face. 

Not losing spirit, he pulled out an apron and a tray of cookies. “Now, for my famous cookies! ” he announced. He had baked them just before the show, but in his excitement, he had added salt instead of sugar. 

He took a big bite to show off but immediately made a funny face. “Mmm! Scrumptious! ” he exclaimed, while the audience burst into laughter. “I call them ‘Salty Surprises! ’ Almost perfect! ”
