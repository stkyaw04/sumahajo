# Chapter 1

Once in a small town called Breezy Hollow, where the sun smiled every day and the wind played with the trees, there lived a boy named Jack. Jack was known for his many talents, but there was one problem: he was a Jack of all trades but a master of none. 

Jack could juggle, swim, paint, and even bake cookies, but he never stuck to one thing long enough to become truly great at it. His friends, Lucy, Tom, and Mia, often teased him about it. 

"Hey, Jack, what are you up to today? " Lucy asked one sunny morning. 

"Maybe I’ll learn the guitar! " Jack replied enthusiastically. 

"You know you said that last week about baking,” Tom laughed. “How did that turn out? "

"Well," Jack said, trying to defend himself, "the cookies looked great! They just didn’t taste quite right. "

"Right? " Mia said, giggling. "Like rocks? "

"Very funny! " Jack pouted, but he couldn’t help but smile. His friends were like that; they cared but loved to poke fun at one another.
