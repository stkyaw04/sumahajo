# Chapter 4

Finally, Jack decided to end his show with a grand finale. “Now, I will attempt the impossible — juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle! ” he declared, even though he had never practiced that before. 

Lucy, Tom, and Mia looked worried. “Jack, are you sure about this? ” Lucy asked, biting her lip. 

“Don’t worry! How hard can it be? ” Jack grinned, putting on a unicycle he borrowed from a friend. He lit the torches and, heart racing, began to juggle. For a moment, everything seemed to go right. The crowd gasped, impressed. 

But then he lost his balance! “Whoa! ” Jack yelled, wobbling and nearly falling off the unicycle. The torches flew out of his hands and landed harmlessly into a soft pile of hay nearby. The crowd erupted in laughter and applause, more amused than scared. 

Jack was a bundle of nerves, but he couldn’t help laughing too. “Well, that was one way to end the show! ” he said, taking a bow. 

As the audience clapped, Jack realized something important. Even though he wasn’t the master of one thing, he still brought joy and smiles to people. His unique mix of talents was what made him special. 

Tom, Lucy, and Mia rushed to the stage. “You know, Jack, you're more fun than anyone,” Tom said, patting his back. 

“You really are our Jack of all trades! ” Mia added with a smile. 

“I guess I’m just a fun mix, after all! ” Jack chuckled, feeling happy. He learned that sometimes it doesn’t matter if you’re a master. What counts is the laughter, the joy you bring, and the memories you create with friends. 

That night, Breezy Hollow went to bed with smiles, and Jack knew he might not be the best at everything, but he was exactly who he needed to be — their beloved Jack.
