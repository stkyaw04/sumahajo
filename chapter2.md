One day, as the group lounged in the park, Jack had an idea. “What if we hosted a talent show? I'll show everyone my skills! "

Lucy’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “That sounds fun! We can all join! ”

Tom scratched his head. “But do we really want to see Jack juggle and bake again? ”

“Oh, come on! This is our chance to shine! ” Jack insisted. 

They all agreed, and the preparations for the Breezy Hollow Talent Show began. Jack whipped up a wide-range of acts in his mind. He imagined himself juggling flaming torches, singing like a superstar, and baking the best cookies ever — all in one night! 

As the day of the talent show approached, Jack spent sleepless nights perfecting his performance. He practiced juggling while riding his bike, tried baking while singing his favorite songs, and even painted a huge sign that read “Jack – The Talent Show Wonder! ”
